In Dart, a factory is a special kind of constructor that can be used to return an instance of a class. The factory keyword is used to indicate that this constructor does not always create a new instance of the class, but instead returns an existing instance or a new instance based on some logic.

Using a factory constructor can be useful in several situations, such as when you want to return a cached instance of an object, or when you want to return a subtype of a class based on some input.

A factory constructor can be used as an alternative to a regular constructor and allows to simplify the code and make it more readable. It can also be used to create a singleton, which is a class that only allows one instance of itself to be created.

In the example provided, the factory Clube.fromJson constructor is used to parse the data from the Firestore documents and it returns a new instance of the Clube class. This constructor does not always create a new instance of the class, but instead it creates a new instance based on the data passed to it.

Using a factory constructor in this case allows for a more readable and maintainable code, because it separates the object creation logic from the rest of the code.
